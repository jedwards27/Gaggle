# Contributing to Gaggle

This guide outlines the standards and practices for contributing to the Gaggle codebase. Following these guidelines helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

## Development Environment Setup

### Node.js Version
- Use Node.js version 20.17.0 or higher
- Use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions
- nvm is installed via Homebrew and configured in ~/.nvm

## Code Quality Standards

### Before Committing
1. **Run Linter**
   - Always run the linter before committing code changes
   - Fix any linting issues before proceeding

2. **Run Tests**
   - All tests must pass before committing changes
   - If tests fail, do not commit and report the failures
   - Fix failing tests before proceeding with the commit

### Code Style
- Follow consistent indentation (spaces vs tabs as per project config)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript types/interfaces where applicable

### Documentation
- Document new features and significant changes
- Update README.md when adding new functionality
- Include JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Document any configuration changes or new dependencies

## Git Workflow

### Branches
- Create feature branches from main/master
- Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-authentication`, `fix/login-error`)
- Keep branches focused on single features or fixes

### Commits
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense in commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commits where applicable
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Pull Requests
- Provide clear PR descriptions
- Link related issues
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- List any breaking changes
- Update documentation if needed

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### Integration Tests
- Add integration tests for new features
- Test interactions between components
- Verify API endpoints and responses
- Test database operations

## Best Practices

### Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Consider bundle size impact

### Security
- Follow security best practices
- Validate user input
- Use proper authentication/authorization
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

### Accessibility
- Maintain WCAG compliance
- Use semantic HTML
- Provide proper ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers
